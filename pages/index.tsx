          {/* I&apos;m Pierre, a 15-year-old developer and I&apos;ve been in IT for
          about 3 years, I started code when I was in 5th grade I got into
          javascript for the purpose of creating Discord Bots, they allow during
          a command executed performed an action, I then saw videos of Minecraft
          Plugins. Knowing that the game is based on Java I immediately knew
          that I should learn another programming language, and then shortly
          after watching videos on YouTube I learned how to organize a project,
          use classes, methods... Then after I was interested in Web2.0 sites, I
          obviously started with HTML and CSS without knowing the existing of
          Front-End Frameworks, VueJS was one of the first it&apos;s hard to
          learn but hey, then I knew AngularJS a bit at the same level then
          VueJS, then came ReactJS it is much simpler and much easier to handle,
          in short I will not go into details. At one point in my life I
          didn&apos;t know the difference between Front-End and Back-End (or
          even the word Full-Stack) while watching videos on YouTube, I mostly
          heard "Front-End" and I looked, I realized that the two were
          completely different, then I learned SpringBoot, also a Framework but
          Back-end, I immediately liked it and I don&apos;t know why I like the
          Back-end, the Full-Stack much more don&apos;t interest me for now.
          After that I continued on the Full-Stack then I asked myself questions
          about how to host the Full-Stack projects I learned quite quickly but
          when you try to put a 24/7 hosting on your PC you quickly go realize
          that you have to leave a terminal open and open its ports... Then I
          got to know Docker, I really like Docker and it&apos;s so simple,
          I&apos;ve never had a limit with Docker but I&apos;m not going to not
          expand on Docker there are so many things to say that good... */}
